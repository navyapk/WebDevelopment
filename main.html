    <p class="col-md-10"> There is no denying that when decent music is playing people cannot help but get in the dancing mood. Studies show that people, even when still in the womb, react to music. This reaction just grows and grows as a person develops... “children between 1 and 2 years of age were made to listen to Credence Clearwater Revival’s “Heard it Through the Grapevine” [and] within a minute of listening to the insistent drums and guitar riffs, the babies started to move in synchronicity with the song (Brenshofl, Roger para. 2). Even though these small children were not able to keep their moves up for long before falling, it sure did not stop them from trying! It is obvious that music and dance are related on a very high level, but what makes these two arts so complimentary of one another? When dance and music are done together there is an emotional response on the deep and superficial level in humans that builds through the practice and evolution of dance and music respectively.
